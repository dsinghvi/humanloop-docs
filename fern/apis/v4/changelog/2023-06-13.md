## Project Editor

We’ve introduced an Editor within each project to help you make it easier to to change prompts and bring in project specific data.

        "The Editor will load up the currently active model config, and will save the generations in the project’s data table."
      ],

      "caption": "The Editor will load up the currently active model config, and will save the generations in the project’s data table."
    }
  ]

You can now also bring datapoints directly to the Editor. Select any datapoints you want to bring to Editor (also through `x` shortcut) and you can choose to open them in Editor (or `e` shortcut)

        null,
        "Press `e` while selecting a datapoint to bring it into Editor"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "caption": "Press `e` while selecting a datapoint to bring it into Editor"
    }
  ]
}

We think this workflow significantly improves the workflow to go from interesting datapoint to improved model config. As always, let us know if you have other feedback.
