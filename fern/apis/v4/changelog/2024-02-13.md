        "Prompt Version authorship in the Prompt Version slideover"
      ],
      "align": "center",
      "sizing": "360px",
      "caption": "Prompt Version authorship in the Prompt Version slideover"

We've also introduced a popover showing more Prompt Version details that shows when you mouseover a Prompt Version's ID.
