## Environment logs

Logs for your deployed prompts will now be tagged with the corresponding [environment](https://docs.humanloop.com/docs/deploy-to-an-environment).

In your logs table, you can now filter your logs based on environment:

[block:image]
{
  "images": [
    {
      "image": [
        "https://files.readme.io/a18dd0f-Screenshot_2023-12-13_at_15.42.35.png",
        "",
        ""
      ],
      "align": "center"
    }
  ]
}
[/block]


You can now also pass an `environment` tag when using the explicit [/log ](https://docs.humanloop.com/reference/logs_log) endpoint; helpful for use cases such as [orchestrating your own models](https://docs.humanloop.com/docs/use-your-own-model-provider).
